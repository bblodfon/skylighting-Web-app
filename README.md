My thesis code for aueb (Athen Univercity of Economics)

Abstract

In this thesis we study and briefly examine different skylight models that have been proposed by the scientific community and we analyze a more recent one which provides an analytic model for full-Spectral Sky-Dome Radiance. This model is used to implement a web-based application which takes input from the user and draws a scene on a canvas element using the JavaScript 3D library three.js. This scene includes a basic 3D-model, a ground plane, the sky Dome, the Sun and the light sources that represent the radiance of the sky. A full explanation is provided for the source code and the functionality of each component of the Web-application as well as some screenshots of the scene, showing different instances of the sky dome and the 3D-model while changing the turbidity, the ground albedo value as well as the solar elevation.

To run the application, just put the skymodel folder inside a web-server (e.g. inside pathToXAMPP/htdocs/ for windows, or in /var/www for Linux) and go to http://localhost/skymodel/skydome.html.
